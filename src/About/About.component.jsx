        I&apos;m a front-end developer from Tampa, Florida who has a passion for
        bringing ideas to life in the web. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work at a
        multibillion-dollar company that empowered technology service providers through
        the innovative tools they provided. Some of my experience stems from working
        on remote monitoring and management software, deployed to over 6 million
        computers across the globe. This presented a unique set of challenges which
        has only encouraged my growth as a web developer. I consider myself naturally
        motivated, congenial in nature, and am always looking for opportunities to
        improve myself.
